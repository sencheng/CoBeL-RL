"""
This demo simulation trains a Q-learning agent moving on a
topological graph. The agent (marked in red) starts at a fixed
location and has to reach a goal node (marked green) to receive a reward.
Images rendered in the Godot game engine serve as observations and are
provided via the GodotSimulator class which overwrites pose observations.
The current node and observation (left plot) as well as the topological
graph and the agent's current location (center plot) are visualized.
Furthermore, the EscapeLatencyMonitor tracks the steps taken in
each trial and visualizes them (right plot).
Per default a linear track topological graph is used in which the
agent starts at the leftmost nodes and the rightmost nodes serve as goals.
The demo simulation can be run using different topological graphs
by providing the appropriate command line arguments:
grid:
    A 5 by 5 grid topological graph with a goal node located at the top right.
    All other nodes are potential starting nodes.
hexagonal:
    A 10 by 10 hexagonal topological graph with a goal node located at the top right.
    All other nodes are potential starting nodes.
t_maze:
    A T-maze topoÄºogical graph with a goal node located at the end of
    the right arm. The agent starts at the beginning of the maze's stem.
