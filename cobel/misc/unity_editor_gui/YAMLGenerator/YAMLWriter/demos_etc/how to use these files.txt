To use these files you must put them into the YAMLWriter folder.
I put them here for the purpose of more structure.

ObjectToYAML_Test.py is a test for ObjectToYAML.py
	results are printed to the console
WriteExampleScene.py is a test for DataToObjectArray.
	this test assumes ObjectToYAML.py and Mathstuff.py work as intended
	results are written to the file testScene.unity
