"""
This module offers a wide range of reinforcement learning environments
as well as 3D simulator interfaces.

Classes
-------
Interface
    Abstract interface class from which all other environments are derived
Gridworld
    A gridworld environment
Topology
    A topology-graph-based environment which can be optionally
    paired with simulators for complex observations
Sequence
    An environment which presents observations in a predefined order
Continuous2D
    A continuous 2-dimensional environment which can be optionally
    paired with a simulator for complex observations
Simulator
    Abstract simulator class from which all other simulators are derived
GodotSimulator
    Allows for interfacing with the Godot simulator
UnitySimulator
    Allows for interfacing with the Unity simulator
OfflineSimulator
    Offline simulator interface which provides pre-rendered observations
